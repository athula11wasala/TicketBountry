CI builds and automation: building, testing, deploying #
When you run a build, Travis CI clones your GitHub repository into a brand new virtual environment,
 and carries out a series of tasks to build and test your code. If one or more of those tasks fails, 
the build is considered broken. If none of the tasks fail, the build is considered passed, and 
Travis CI can deploy your code to a web server, or application host.
